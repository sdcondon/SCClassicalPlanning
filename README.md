# SCClassicalPlanning

Very simple classical planning implementations. These are implementations of some of the concepts described in chapter 10 of _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd Edition - [ISBN 978-1292153964](https://www.google.com/search?q=isbn+978-1292153964)). Specifically:

* The (significantly cut-down - a small subset of PDDL 1.2) version of [Planning Domain Definition Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language) as described in this chapter.
* A few basic planner implementations. One that uses forward state space search, one that uses backward state space search, and one that uses graphplan.

Created just for fun while reading the chapter - so may prove interesting to the .NET-inclined reading the same book.
The main goal here is for it to be a learning resource - as such, care has been taken to include decent XML documentation and explanatory inline comments where appropriate.
