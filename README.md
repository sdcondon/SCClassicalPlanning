# SCClassicalPlanning

Very simple [classical planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling#Classical_planning) implementations.

Created just for fun while reading _Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_ (3rd Edition - [ISBN 978-1292153964](https://www.google.com/search?q=isbn+978-1292153964)) - so may prove interesting to the .NET-inclined reading the same book.
The main goal here is for it to be a learning resource - as such, care has been taken to include decent XML documentation and explanatory inline comments where appropriate.

For usage guidance, please consult the [user guide](./docs/user-guide).
