# SCClassicalPlanning

[![NuGet version (SCClassicalPlanning)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SCClassicalPlanning.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SCClassicalPlanning/) [![NuGet downloads (SCClassicalPlanning)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/SCClassicalPlanning.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SCClassicalPlanning/)

This repository contains the source code for the SCClassicalPlanning NuGet package - in addition to its tests, benchmarks, alternative implementations, example domains and documentation website.

## Package Documentation

For documentation of the package itself, see https://sdcondon.net/SCClassicalPlanning/.

## Source Documentation

I haven't written up any documentation of the source (e.g. repo overview, design discussion, compilation guidance…) - and likely won't unless someone else expresses an interest in contributing.
I use Visual Studio, and once cloned, it should "just work" as far as compiling is concerned.

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not really expecting anyone to want to get involved at this stage (or indeed ever), but please feel free to do so.
I do keep a vague eye on the [issues](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCClassicalPlanning/issues) tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
Do bear in mind that I have a very particular scope in mind for the library, though.
When we reach the point where I feel that it does a good job of its "learning and experimenting" remit and offers sufficient means of extension, I'll view it as done (and suggest that any extensions belong in their own packages).

## See Also

Like this? If so, it might also be worth taking a look at:

* [SCFirstOrderLogic](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCFirstOrderLogic): Basic first-order logic implementations. Based on chapters 8 and 9 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach". Depended on by this package (for its first-order logic model).
* [SCGraphTheory.Search](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCGraphTheory.Search): Graph theory search algorithms. Depended on by this package (for state space search).
* [AIMA Code - C#](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-csharp): I mention this only because I feel like I should. This is the "official" C# repository for "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" - and it is.. err.. not great.
* [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/sdcondon): My profile README lists a whole bunch of stuff that I've made.
