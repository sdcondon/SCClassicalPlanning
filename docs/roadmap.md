# Roadmap

### V1 Milestone

I'll be happy to call it v1 when:

* We have simple implementations of state space search heuristic that could be described as using "ignore preconditions" and "ignore delete lists"
* We have a simple PlanningGraph implementation
* We have a simple GraphPlan implementation
* I've at least considered all of the existing TODOs. Most notably the ones around State abstraction and state indexing - so its at least conceivable that someone could extend it to be workable with large (secondary-storage requiring) problems.
